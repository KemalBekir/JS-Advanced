# JS-Advanced

In the "JS Advanced" module, you will get to know more deeply the functionality of the JavaScript language, with the environment in which it is most often used and for which it was created - the browser. We'll look at JavaScript as a basic syntax, as well as introduce programming concepts through the lens of the language. What is functional programming and how it differs from object-oriented programming. You will study in detail the elements of the browser, the DOM tree, how to add, remove and edit the elements in it. What is unit testing and what are the main concepts in code testing. At the end of the module, you will have the necessary knowledge to create Single Page Applications written entirely in JavaScript, using concepts such as Routing and Templating.
